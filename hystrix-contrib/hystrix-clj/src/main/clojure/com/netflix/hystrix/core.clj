  "THESE BINDINGS ARE EXPERIMENTAL AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE

  Functions for defining and executing Hystrix dependency commands and collapsers.

  The definition of commands and collapers is separated from their instantiation and execution.
  They are represented as plain Clojure maps (see below) which are later instantiated into
  functional HystrixCommand or HystrixCollapser instances. defcommand and defcollapser macros
  are provided to assist in defining these maps.

  A command or collapser definition map can be passed to the execute and queue functions to
  invoke the command.

  The main Hystrix documentation can be found at https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix. In particular,
  you may find the Javadocs useful if you need to drop down into Java:
  http://netflix.github.io/Hystrix/javadoc/

  # HystrixCommand

  A HystrixCommand is a representation for an interaction with a network dependency, or other
  untrusted resource. See the Hystrix documentation (https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) for
  more details.

  A command is defined by a map with the following keys:

    :type

      Always :command. Required.

    :group-key

      A HystrixCommandGroupKey, string, or keyword. Required.

    :command-key

      A HystrixCommandKey, string, or keyword. Required.

    :thread-pool-key

      A HystrixThreadPoolKey, string, or keyword. Optional, defaults to :group-key.

    :run-fn

      The function to run for the command. The function may have any number of
      arguments. Required.

    :fallback-fn

      A function with the same args as :run-fn that calculates a fallback result when
      the command fails. Optional, defaults to a function that throws UnsupportedOperationException.

    :cache-key-fn

      A function which the same args as :run-fn that calculates a cache key for the
      given args. Optional, defaults to nil, i.e. no caching.

    :init-fn

      A function that takes a definition map and HystrixCommand$Setter which should return
      a HystrixCommand$Setter (usually the one passed in) to ultimately be passed to the
      constructor of the HystrixCommand. For example,

          (fn [_ setter]
            (.andCommandPropertiesDefaults setter ...))

      This is your escape hatch into raw Hystrix.
      ... but NOTE: Hystrix does a fair bit of configuration caching and that caching is keyed
      by command key. Thus, many of the settings you apply within :init-fn will only apply
      the *first time it is invoked*. After that, they're ignored. This means that some REPL-based
      dynamicism is lost and that :init-fn shouldn't be used to configure a HystrixCommand at
      run-time. Instead use Archaius properties as described in the Hystrix docs.

  The com.netflix.hystrix.core/defcommand macro is a helper for defining this map and storing it
  in a var. For example, here's a definition for an addition command:

    ; Define a command with :group-key set to the current namespace, *ns*, and with :command-key
    ; set to \"plus\". The function the command executes is clojure.core/+.
    (defcommand plus
      \"My resilient addition operation\"
      [& args]
      (apply + args))
    ;=> #'user/plus

    ; Execute the command
    (plus 1 2 3 4 5)
    ;=> 15

    ; Queue the command for async operation
    (def f (queue #'plus 4 5))
    ;=> java.util.concurrent.Future/clojure.lang.IDeref

    ; Now you can deref the future as usual
    @f   ; or (.get f)
    ;=> 9

  # HystrixCollapser

  A HystrixCollapser allows multiple HystrixCommand requests to be batched together if the underlying
  resource provides such a capability. See the Hystrix documentation (https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix)
  for more details.

  A collapser is defined by a map with the following keys:

    :type

      Always :collapser. Required.

    :collapser-key

      A HystrixCollapserKey, string, or keyword. Required.

    :collapse-fn

      A fn that takes a sequence of arg lists and instantiates a new command to
      execute them. Required. See com.netflix.hystrix.core/instantiate.  This
      function should be completely free of side effects.

    :map-fn

      A fn that takes sequence of arg lists (as passed to :collapse-fn) and the
      result from the command created by :collapse-fn. Must return a sequence of
      results where the nth element is the result or exception associated with the
      nth arg list. The arg lists are in the same order as passed to :collapse-fn.
      Required.  This function should be completely free of side effects.

    :scope

      The collapser scope, :request or :global. Optional, defaults to :request.

    :shard-fn

      A fn that takes a sequence of arg lists and shards them, returns a sequence of
      sequence of arg lists. Optional, defaults to no sharding.  This function should
      be completely free of side effects.

    :cache-key-fn

      A function that calculates a String cache key for the args passed to the
      collapser. Optional, defaults to a function returning nil, i.e. no caching.
      This function should be completely free of side effects.

    :init-fn

      A function that takes a definition map and HystrixCollapser$Setter which should return
      a HystrixCollapser$Setter (usually the one passed in) to ultimately be passed to the
      constructor of the HystrixCollapser. For example,

          (fn [_ setter]
            (.andCollapserPropertiesDefaults setter ...))

      This is your escape hatch into raw Hystrix. Please see additional notes about :init-fn
      above. They apply to collapsers as well.

  The com.netflix.hystric.core/defcollapser macro is a helper for defining this map and storing it
  in a callable var.
