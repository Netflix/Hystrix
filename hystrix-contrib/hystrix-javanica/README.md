# hystrix-javanica

Java language has a great advantages over other languages such as reflection and annotations.
All modern frameworks such as Spring, Hibernate, myBatis and etc. seek to use this advantages to the maximum.
The idea of introduction annotations in Hystrix is obvious solution for improvement. Currently using Hystrix involves writing a lot of code that is a barrier to rapid development. You likely be spending a lot of time on writing a Hystrix commands. Idea of the Javanica project is make easier using of Hystrix by the introduction of support annotations.

First of all in order to use hystrix-javanica you need to add hystrix-javanica dependency in your project.

Example for Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.netflix.hystrix</groupId>
    <artifactId>hystrix-javanica</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
```

To implement AOP functionality in the project was used AspectJ library. If in your project already used AspectJ then you need to add hystrix aspect in aop.xml as below:
```xml
<aspects>
        ...
        <aspect name="com.netflix.hystrix.contrib.javanica.aop.aspectj.HystrixCommandAspect"/>
        ...
</aspects>
```
More about AspectJ configuration read [here] (http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/next/devguide/ltw-configuration.html)


If you use Spring AOP in your project then you need to add specific configuration using Spring aop namespace in order to make Spring capable to manage aspects which were written using AspectJ and declare HystrixAspect as Spring bean like below:

```xml
    <aop:aspectj-autoproxy/>
    <bean id="hystrixAspect" class="com.netflix.hystrix.contrib.javanica.aop.aspectj.HystrixCommandAspect"></bean>
```

Or if you are using code configuration:

```java
@Configuration
public class HystrixConfiguration {

  @Bean
  public HystrixCommandAspect hystrixAspect() {
    return new HystrixCommandAspect();
  }

}
```

It doesn't matter which approach you use to create proxies in Spring, javanica works fine with JDK and CGLIB proxies. If you use another framework for aop which supports AspectJ and uses other libs (Javassist for instance) to create proxies then let us know what lib you use to create proxies and we'll try to add support for this library in near future.

# How to use

## Hystrix command
### Synchronous Execution

To run method as Hystrix command synchronously you need to annotate method with `@HystrixCommand` annotation, for example
```java
public class UserService {
...
    @HystrixCommand
    public User getUserById(String id) {
        return userResource.getUserById(id);
    }
}
...
```
In example above the `getUserById` method will be processed [synchronously](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/How-To-Use#wiki-Synchronous-Execution) within new Hystrix command. 
By default the name of **command key** is command method name: `getUserById`, default **group key** name is class name of annotated method: `UserService`. You can change it using necessary `@HystrixCommand` properties:

```java
    @HystrixCommand(groupKey="UserGroup", commandKey = "GetUserByIdCommand")
    public User getUserById(String id) {
        return userResource.getUserById(id);
    }
```
To set threadPoolKey use ```@HystrixCommand#threadPoolKey()```

### Asynchronous Execution

To process Hystrix command asynchronously you should return an instance of `AsyncResult` in your command method as in the exapmple below:
```java
    @HystrixCommand
    public Future<User> getUserByIdAsync(final String id) {
        return new AsyncResult<User>() {
            @Override
            public User invoke() {
                return userResource.getUserById(id);
            }
        };
    }
```

The return type of command method should be Future that indicates that a command should be executed [asynchronously] (https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/How-To-Use#wiki-Asynchronous-Execution).

## Reactive Execution

To performe "Reactive Execution" you should return an instance of `ObservableResult` in your command method as in the exapmple below:

```java
    @HystrixCommand
    public Observable<User> getUserById(final String id) {
        return new ObservableResult<User>() {
            @Override
            public User invoke() {
                return userResource.getUserById(id);
            }
        };
    }
```

The return type of command method should be `Observable`.

## Fallback

Graceful degradation can be achieved by declaring name of fallback method in `@HystrixCommand` like below:

```java
    @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "defaultUser")
    public User getUserById(String id) {
        return userResource.getUserById(id);
    }

    private User defaultUser(String id) {
        return new User("def", "def");
    }
```

**_Its important to remember that Hystrix command and fallback should be placed in the same class and have same method signature_**.

Fallback method can have any access modifier. Method `defaultUser` will be used to process fallback logic in a case of any errors. If you need to run fallback method `defaultUser` as separate Hystrix command then you need to annotate it with `HystrixCommand` annotation as below:
```java
    @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "defaultUser")
    public User getUserById(String id) {
        return userResource.getUserById(id);
    }

    @HystrixCommand
    private User defaultUser(String id) {
        return new User();
    }
```

If fallback method was marked with `@HystrixCommand` then this fallback method (_defaultUser_) also can has own fallback method, as in the example below:
```java
    @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "defaultUser")
    public User getUserById(String id) {
        return userResource.getUserById(id);
    }

    @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "defaultUserSecond")
    private User defaultUser(String id) {
        return new User();
    }
    
    @HystrixCommand
    private User defaultUserSecond(String id) {
        return new User("def", "def");
    }
```

## Error Propagation
Based on [this](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/How-To-Use#ErrorPropagation) description, `@HystrixCommand` has an ability to specify exceptions types which should be ignored and wrapped to throw in `HystrixBadRequestException`.

```java
    @HystrixCommand(ignoreExceptions = {BadRequestException.class})
    public User getUserById(String id) {
        return userResource.getUserById(id);
    }
```

If `userResource.getUserById(id);` throws an exception which type is _BadRequestException_ then this exception will be wrapped in `HystrixBadRequestException` and will not affect metrics and will not trigger fallback logic.

## Request Cache

Request caching is enabled by defining the _get cache key_ method like in example below:
```java
    @HystrixCommand(cacheKeyMethod = "getUserIdCacheKey")
    public User getUserById(String id) {
        return userResource.getUserById(id);
    }

    private String getUserIdCacheKey(String id){
        return id;
    }
```

If "getUserIdCacheKey" returns `null` then the cache key will be "null" (string).

**_Its important to remember that Hystrix command and "get cache key" method should be placed in the same class and have same method signature_**.

## Configuration
### Command Properties

Command properties can be set using @HystrixCommand's 'commandProperties' like below:

```java
    @HystrixCommand(commandProperties = {
            @HystrixProperty(name = "execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds", value = "500")
        })
    public User getUserById(String id) {
        return userResource.getUserById(id);
    }
```

Javanica dynamically sets properties using Hystrix ConfigurationManager.
For the example above Javanica behind the scenes performs next action:
```java
ConfigurationManager.getConfigInstance().setProperty("hystrix.command.getUserById.execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds", "500");
```
More about Hystrix command properties [command](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Configuration#wiki-CommandExecution) and [fallback](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Configuration#wiki-CommandFallback)

ThreadPoolProperties can be set using @HystrixCommand's 'threadPoolProperties' like below:

```java
    @HystrixCommand(commandProperties = {
            @HystrixProperty(name = "execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds", value = "500")
        },
                threadPoolProperties = {
                        @HystrixProperty(name = "coreSize", value = "30"),
                        @HystrixProperty(name = "maxQueueSize", value = "101"),
                        @HystrixProperty(name = "keepAliveTimeMinutes", value = "2"),
                        @HystrixProperty(name = "queueSizeRejectionThreshold", value = "15"),
                        @HystrixProperty(name = "metrics.rollingStats.numBuckets", value = "12"),
                        @HystrixProperty(name = "metrics.rollingStats.timeInMilliseconds", value = "1440")
        })
    public User getUserById(String id) {
        return userResource.getUserById(id);
    }
```

## Hystrix collapser

Suppose you have some command which calls should be collapsed in one backend call. For this goal you can use ```@HystrixCollapser``` annotation.

**Asynchronous call**
```java
        @HystrixCommand
        @HystrixCollapser
        public Future<User> getUserAsync(final String id, final String name) {
            return new AsyncResult<User>() {
                @Override
                public User invoke() {
                    return new User(id, name + id); // there should be a network call
                }
            };
        }
```

**Synchronous call**
_Note_ : Request collapsing on a single thread makes no sense, because if a single thread is invoking ```execute()``` or ```queue().get()``` synchronously it will block and wait for a response and thus not submit any further requests that will be collapsed inside the window. Doing requests on a separate threads (such as user requests with collapsing scope set to GLOBAL) would make sense:

```java
        @HystrixCommand
        @HystrixCollapser(scope = GLOBAL)
        public User getUserSync(String id, String name) {
            return new User(id, name + id); // there should be a network call
        }
```

To set collapser [properties](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Configuration#Collapser) use `@HystrixCollapser#collapserProperties`

Read more about Hystrix request collapsing [here] (https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/How-it-Works#wiki-RequestCollapsing)

**Collapser error processing**

All commands are collapsed are instances of ```BatchHystrixCommand```. In BatchHystrixCommand the ```getFallback()``` isn't implemented, even if a collapsed command has fallback ``` @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "fallbackCommand")``` then it never be processed in ```getFallback()```, below this moment is consecrated in detail.

If the processing of a request fails then other requests will not be processed within this collapser and ```setException``` method will be automatically called on requests instances. Generally this is an all or nothing affair. For example, a timeout or rejection of the HystrixCommand would cause failure on all of the batched calls. Thus existence of fallback method does not eliminate the break of all requests and the collapser as a whole. Thus there are two scenarios that you can change using ```@HystrixCollapser#fallbackEnabled``` annotation property.

When one of the requests has failed:

**Scenario #1** (```@HystrixCollapser(fallbackEnabled = false)```):

All requests that were processed successfully will be returned to an user and will be available from Future, other requests including one that failed will not. The fallback of collapsed command will not be executed in a case of any errors.
Short example:
```java

 @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "fallback")
        @HystrixCollapser(fallbackEnabled = false)
        public Future<User> getUserAsync(final String id, final String name) {
            // some logic here
            };
            
        // .......


            Future<User> f1 = userService.getUserAsync("1", "name: ");
            Future<User> f2 = userService.getUserAsync("2", "name: ");
            Future<User> f3 = userService.getUserAsync("not found", "name"); // not found, exception here
            Future<User> f4 = userService.getUserAsync("4", "name: "); // will not be processed
            Future<User> f5 = userService.getUserAsync("5", "name: "); // will not be processed
            System.out.println(f1.get().getName()); // this line will be executed
            System.out.println(f2.get().getName()); // this line will be executed
            System.out.println(f3.get().getName()); // this line will not be executed
            System.out.println(f4.get().getName()); // this line will not be executed
            System.out.println(f5.get().getName()); // this line will not be executed
```

**Scenario #2** (```@HystrixCollapser(fallbackEnabled = true)```):

All requests that were processed successfully or failed will be returned to an user and will be available from a Future instance. For failed requests the collapsed command's fallback method will be executed, of course if the name of fallback method was defined in ```@HystrixCommand```. The fallback of collapsed command will be used to process any exceptions during batch processing. If the fallback method hasn't ```@HystrixCommand``` annotation then this method will be processed in the a single thread with the BatchHystrixCommand in method _run()_, otherwise fallback will be process as Hystrix command in separate thread if fallback method was annotated with ```@HystrixCommand```. This is important point that you need to pay attention if you want to use fallback for your collapsed command. Thus fallback method will be processed in ```BatchHystrixCommand#run()``` not in ```BatchHystrixCommand#getFallback()```, but fallback can be process as Hystrix command therefore set the ```fallbackEnabled``` as true can be useful in some situations to avoid crash of whole collapser and continue to process requests, but I recommend to use ```@HystrixCollapser(fallbackEnabled = false)``` and give preference to the first scenario as this is the correct behavior in most cases.


#Development Status and Future
Todo list:

1. Add new annotation that can be applied for types in order to define default command properties for all commands that are specified in a class. For example specify default group key or default properties for all commands.
2.Add Cache annotation to mark some parameters which should participate in building cache key, for example:

```java
@HystrixCommand
User getUserByParams(@Cache String id, String name, @Cache Integer age)
```
`toString()` method will be invoked for parameters: id and age to build cache key:
Pseudo code
```
String cacheKey = id.toString()+age.toString()
```
