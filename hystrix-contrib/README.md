## hystrix-contrib

This is the parent of all "contrib" submodules to Hystrix. 

Examples of what makes sense as a contrib submodule are:

- alternative metrics publishers
- alternative properties strategies
- request lifecycle implementations (such as [hystrix-request-servlet](./hystrix-request-servlet))
- event notification plugins
- dashboard and monitoring tools

3rd partly libraries wrapped with Hystrix do not belong here and should be their own project.

They can however be referenced from the Wiki [Libraries](../../wiki/Libraries) page.
