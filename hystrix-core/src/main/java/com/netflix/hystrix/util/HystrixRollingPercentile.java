/**
 * Add values to a rolling window and retrieve percentile calculations such as median, 90th, 99th, etc.
 * <p>
 * The underlying data structure contains a circular array of buckets that "roll" over time.
 * <p>
 * For example, if the time window is configured to 60 seconds with 12 buckets of 5 seconds each, values will be captured in each 5 second bucket and rotate each 5 seconds.
 * <p>
 * This means that percentile calculations are for the "rolling window" of 55-60 seconds up to 5 seconds ago.
 * <p>
 * Each bucket will contain a circular array of long values and if more than the configured amount (1000 values for example) it will wrap around and overwrite values until time passes and a new bucket
 * is allocated. This sampling approach for high volume metrics is done to conserve memory and reduce sorting time when calculating percentiles.

         * are thread-safe by themselves but not the aggregate algorithm, thus we put this entire block of logic inside synchronized.

         * 
         * This means the timing won't be exact to the millisecond as to what data ends up in a bucket, but that's acceptable.
         * It's not critical to have exact precision to the millisecond, as long as it's rolling, if we can instead reduce the impact synchronization.
         * 
         * More importantly though it means that the 'if' block within the lock needs to be careful about what it changes that can still
         * be accessed concurrently in the 'else' block since we're not completely synchronizing access.
         * 
         * For example, we can't have a multi-step process to add a bucket, remove a bucket, then update the sum since the 'else' block of code
         * can retrieve the sum while this is all happening. The trade-off is that we don't maintain the rolling sum and let readers just iterate
         * bucket to calculate the sum themselves. This is an example of favoring write-performance instead of read-performance and how the tryLock
         * versus a synchronized block needs to be accommodated.
