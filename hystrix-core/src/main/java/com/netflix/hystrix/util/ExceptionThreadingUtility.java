                 * 
                 * It works well when someone does Command.execute() since the calling threads blocks so its stacktrace shows exactly what is calling the command.
                 * 
                 * It won't necessarily work very well with Command.queue() since the calling thread will be off doing something else when this occurs.
                 * 
                 * I'm also somewhat concerned about the thread-safety of this. I have no idea what the guarantees are, but we haven't seen issues such as deadlocks, infinite loops, etc and no known
                 * data corruption.
                 * 
                 * I'm not a fan of this solution, but it is better so far than not having it.
                 * 
                 * The cleaner alternative would be to capture the stackTrace when the command is queued, but I'm concerned with the performance implications of capturing the stackTrace on every
                 * single invocation when we only need it in error events which are rare. I have not performed any testing to determine the cost, but it certainly has a cost based on looking at the
                 * java source code for getStackTrace().
