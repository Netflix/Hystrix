/**
 * A number which can be used to track counters (increment) or set values over time.
 * <p>
 * It is "rolling" in the sense that a 'timeInMilliseconds' is given that you want to track (such as 10 seconds) and then that is broken into buckets (defaults to 10) so that the 10 second window
 * doesn't empty out and restart every 10 seconds, but instead every 1 second you have a new bucket added and one dropped so that 9 of the buckets remain and only the newest starts from scratch.
 * <p>
 * This is done so that the statistics are gathered over a rolling 10 second window with data being added/dropped in 1 second intervals (or whatever granularity is defined by the arguments) rather
 * than each 10 second window starting at 0 again.
 * <p>
 * Performance-wise this class is optimized for writes, not reads. This is done because it expects far higher write volume (thousands/second) than reads (a few per second).
 * <p>
 * For example, on each read to getSum/getCount it will iterate buckets to sum the data so that on writes we don't need to maintain the overall sum and pay the synchronization cost at each write to
 * ensure the sum is up-to-date when the read can easily iterate each bucket to get the sum when it needs it.
 * <p>
 * See UnitTest for usage and expected behavior examples.

         * are thread-safe by themselves but not the aggregate algorithm, thus we put this entire block of logic inside synchronized.
         * 
         * I am using a tryLock if/then (http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html#tryLock())

         * (and it makes sense that it should as well).
         * 
         * This means the timing won't be exact to the millisecond as to what data ends up in a bucket, but that's acceptable.
         * It's not critical to have exact precision to the millisecond, as long as it's rolling, if we can instead reduce the impact synchronization.
         * 
         * More importantly though it means that the 'if' block within the lock needs to be careful about what it changes that can still
         * be accessed concurrently in the 'else' block since we're not completely synchronizing access.
         * 
         * For example, we can't have a multi-step process to add a bucket, remove a bucket, then update the sum since the 'else' block of code
         * can retrieve the sum while this is all happening. The trade-off is that we don't maintain the rolling sum and let readers just iterate
         * bucket to calculate the sum themselves. This is an example of favoring write-performance instead of read-performance and how the tryLock
         * versus a synchronized block needs to be accommodated.
