             * --- Non-Blocking Timeout (performAsyncTimeout:true) ---
             * 
             * When 'toObservable' is done with non-blocking timeout then timeout functionality is provided
             * by a separate HystrixTimer thread that will "tick" and cancel the underlying async Future inside the Observable.
             * 
             * This method allows stealing that responsibility and letting the thread that's going to block anyways
             * do the work to reduce pressure on the HystrixTimer.
             * 
             * Blocking via queue().get() on a non-blocking timeout will work it's just less efficient
             * as it involves an extra thread and cancels the scheduled action that does the timeout.
             * 
             * --- Blocking Timeout (performAsyncTimeout:false) ---
             * 
             * When blocking timeout is assumed (default behavior for execute/queue flows) then the async
             * timeout will not have been scheduled and this will wait in a blocking manner and if a timeout occurs
             * trigger the timeout logic that comes from inside the Observable/Observer.
             * 
             *
