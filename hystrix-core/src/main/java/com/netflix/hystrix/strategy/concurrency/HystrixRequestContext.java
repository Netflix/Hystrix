/**
 * Contains the state and manages the lifecycle of {@link HystrixRequestVariableDefault} objects that provide request scoped (rather than only thread scoped) variables so that multiple threads within
 * a
 * single request can share state:
 * <ul>
 * <li>request scoped caching as in {@link HystrixRequestCache} for de-duping {@link HystrixCommand} executions</li>
 * <li>request scoped log of all events as in {@link HystrixRequestLog}</li>
 * <li>automated batching of {@link HystrixCommand} executions within the scope of a request as in {@link HystrixCollapser}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If those features are not used then this does not need to be used. If those features are used then this must be initialized or a custom implementation of {@link HystrixRequestVariable} must be
 * returned from {@link HystrixConcurrencyStrategy#getRequestVariable}.
 * <p>
 * If {@link HystrixRequestVariableDefault} is used (directly or indirectly by above-mentioned features) and this context has not been initialized then an {@link IllegalStateException} will be thrown
 * with a
 * message such as: <blockquote> HystrixRequestContext.initializeContext() must be called at the beginning of each request before RequestVariable functionality can be used. </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Example ServletFilter for initializing {@link HystrixRequestContext} at the beginning of an HTTP request and shutting down at the end:
 * 
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException {
 *      HystrixRequestContext context = HystrixRequestContext.initializeContext();
 *      try {
 *           chain.doFilter(request, response);
 *      } finally {
 *           context.shutdown();
 *      }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote>

 * You can find an implementation at <a target="_top" href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/tree/master/hystrix-contrib/hystrix-request-servlet">hystrix-contrib/hystrix-request-servlet</a> on GitHub.
