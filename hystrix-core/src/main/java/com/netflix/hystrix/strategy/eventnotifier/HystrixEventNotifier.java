 * <b>Note on thread-safety and performance</b>
 * <p>
 * A single implementation of this class will be used globally so methods on this class will be invoked concurrently from multiple threads so all functionality must be thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * Methods are also invoked synchronously and will add to execution time of the commands so all behavior should be fast. If anything time-consuming is to be done it should be spawned asynchronously
 * onto separate worker threads.
