/**
 * The Observable that represents a collapsed request sent back to a user.  It gets used by Collapser implementations
 * when receiving a batch response and emitting values/errors to collapsers.
 *
 * There are 4 methods that Collapser implementations may use:
 *
 * 1) {@link #setResponse(T)}: return a single-valued response.  equivalent to OnNext(T), OnCompleted()
 * 2) {@link #emitResponse(T)}: emit a single value.  equivalent to OnNext(T)
 * 3) {@link #setException(Exception)}: return an exception.  equivalent to OnError(Excception)
 * 4) {@link #setComplete()}: mark that no more values will be emitted.  Should be used in conjunction with {@link #emitResponse(T)}.  equivalent to OnCompleted()
 *
 * <p>
 * This is an internal implementation class that combines the Observable<T> and CollapsedRequest<T, R> functionality.
 * <p>
 * We publicly expose these via interfaces only since we want clients to only see Observable<T> and implementors to only see CollapsedRequest<T, R>, not the combination of the two.
 * 
 * @param <T>

 * @param <R>
